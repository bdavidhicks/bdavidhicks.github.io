#### and again!

Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.
Markdown is nice because you can make lists
*   use them to show
*   unordered things

or

1.  An ordered
2.  list that can have
    *   sublists like
    *   this

Can show code too! Javascript
<pre><code class="js">console.log('Good job');
// Good Job
</code></pre>

Python
<pre><code class="python">for i in range(2):
  print('Good job');
# Good Job
# Good Job
</code></pre>

SQL
<pre><code class="sql">SELECT * FROM users WHERE clue > 0;
-- 0 rows returned
</code></pre>
